# kahootbot
so obviously you're gonna need to make a file named something like "KahootBot" <br>
you're gonna have to install node for this.<br>
after you install node, in (terminal for mac, command prompt/powershell for windows) type and send "npm install"<br>
then go to terminal and navigate to the KahootBot folder<br>
then put in "npm start"<br>
after that the program will ask you a couple questions like the game id, how many bots you want to have, what their names should be, etc<br>
then the bots will go flooding the game!<br>
note that closing the program will cause all the bots to leave<br>
yeah<br>
