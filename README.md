# kahootbot
so obviously you're gonna need to make a file named something like "KahootBot"
you're gonna have to install node for this.
after you install node, in terminal type and send "npm install"
then go to terminal and navigate to the KahootBot folder
then put in "npm start"
after that the program will ask you a couple questions like the game id, how many bots you want to have, what their names should be, etc
then the bots will go flooding the game!
note that closing the program will cause all the bots to leave
yeah
